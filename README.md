# AEH-W4G2 Replacement Software for Hisense AC Units

This is a work-in-progress (WiP) replacement software designed as an alternative to AEH-W4G2 for Hisense air conditioning units. This software is an ESPHome component and can be installed on AEH-W4G2 via UART or on other devices compatible with ESPHome.

Important Notice:

- This software has only been tested with my specific Hisense AC unit. Compatibility with other units is not guaranteed and it may not work as intended, or could potentially cause issues.
Use this software at your own risk. 

- I am not responsible for any damage to hardware, fire, or any other consequences that may arise from using this software.
